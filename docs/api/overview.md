# Reference Overview

## Component Documentation
Components are typically structured as:
```
Component
    <Component>
        Properties
        Callbacks
        Raw Interface
```
The **Component** section contains basic information about the usage and behavior of the component. It may contain additional headings for examples.

The **\<Component>** section contains properties and callbacks of the component.
**Raw Interface** contains a code block referencing the Props interface extracted from the component. You will likely never need it.
